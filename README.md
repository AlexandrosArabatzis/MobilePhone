		// Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following
		// capabilities.
		// Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
		// You will want to create a separate class for Contacts (name and phone
		// number).
		// Create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts
		// The MobilePhone class has the functionality listed above.
		// Add a menu of options that are available.
		// Options: Quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing
		// contact, remove contact
		// and search/find contact.
		// When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exists (use
		// name)
		// Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the Arraylist to MobilePhone
		// e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc
		// MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only.
